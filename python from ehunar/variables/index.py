# a , b = 10 , 20/2
# print(a, b)
# #  augumented assignment
# a = 20
# a +=20
# print("a=",a *2/5)

#  string concatination
#  it is basically when we have to add two or more string
# str1= "hello "
# str2= " i am waqas"
# so there are three ways to add it
# str= str1 + str2
# print(str1+str2)
num1 =int(5)
num2 =int(input("enter a number:")) 
print(num1 + num2)
#  so in this we add something like this
