# So in this we learn about the data types
print(round(3.4))
# () parenthesis
# Exponent
# ** Power
# */ multipliction and division
# +- addition and substration
# overall it make PEMDAS
#  its mean when there is something to solve in the programming a large number of code we create in them and if 
#  there is some mathimethical operation to peform on that so it can be very clear to do it through the PEMDAS
